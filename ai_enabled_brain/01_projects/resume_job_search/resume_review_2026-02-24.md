# Resume Review — Nicolas Paris (2026-02-24)

## Stored Resume
- PDF: `01_projects/resume_job_search/Nicolas_Paris_Resume_2026-02.pdf`
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasparis/

## Quick Assessment (Recruiter Lens)

### What’s strong
- Strong senior positioning (CTO, Head of Product Engineering, global/regulated-industry exposure)
- Clear business impact with several metrics (ARR, TCV, uptime, MAU, efficiency gains)
- Good credibility signals: ADB, DBS, Prudential, SingHealth, Fortune 500 pharma, AWS certs
- Rare blend of technical depth + GTM/pre-sales + delivery

### Main weaknesses to fix
1. **Headline is too broad / keyword-fragmented**
   - `CTO - SOFTWARE PLATFORMS & GEN AI` can be clearer and more ATS-friendly.
   - Better: `Chief Technology Officer | Generative AI, Data Platforms, Product Engineering`.

2. **Summary is strong but too dense and claim-heavy**
   - Contains many claims in one block ("hallucination-free", "elite teams", "trusted by Fortune 500 leaders").
   - Needs tighter phrasing and role-targeting variants (CTO vs VP Eng vs Head of AI).

3. **Inconsistent formatting and punctuation**
   - Date/location style varies; punctuation spacing issues (`( 99.95% uptime )`, `7m$`, `2m USD` etc.).
   - Some grammar and naming issues (e.g., `Asia Development Bank` vs `Asian Development Bank`; `Aboitiz` sentence clarity).

4. **Metrics are strong but not standardized**
   - Mix of formats (`500k USD`, `1M ARR`, `7m$`, `2m USD`) hurts polish.
   - Normalize currency and units for executive readability.

5. **Additional Experience section is underdeveloped**
   - `2004-2014: Business Analyst...` is too vague for 10 years.
   - Add at least 2–3 bullets or compress with a narrative line that ties progression to current leadership scope.

6. **ATS keyword coverage can be improved**
   - Add explicit terms recruiters search for: `LLM`, `RAG`, `AI governance`, `MLOps`, `Data platform`, `Enterprise SaaS`, `Product strategy`, `P&L`, `Stakeholder management`, `Digital transformation`.

## Suggested Next Iteration Plan
1. Build 3 targeted versions:
   - CTO / VP Engineering
   - Head of AI / GenAI Leader
   - Product & Platform Transformation Leader
2. Rewrite summary into a 3-line hook with one quantified value proof per line.
3. Standardize all metrics and style.
4. Tighten each role to 3–5 high-impact bullets max.
5. Add a dedicated `Core Competencies` section for ATS.

## Example 3-Line Hook (Draft)
CTO and AI platform leader with 19 years of experience scaling enterprise products across finance and healthcare.
Delivered 6 production GenAI solutions for the Asian Development Bank (US$2M total contract value), including RAG and workflow automation with up to 75% workload reduction.
Built and led cross-functional engineering organizations that grew ARR beyond US$1M while maintaining up to 99.99% uptime in regulated environments.
