# Job Search Strategy — Strategic Reality Assessment (2026-02-24)

## I. Strategic Reality Assessment

### 1) Current Situation
- 45 years old
- Single income household → moderate risk tolerance
- Built GenAI stack at Asian Development Bank
- Currently in structurally undermined role at Standard Chartered
- Clear internal decision: must exit
- Timeline: 3–6 months runway, out before Christmas 2026

**Key insight:** The risk is not startup volatility. The risk is career drift in a politically neutralized AI function.

---

### 2) Psychological Clarification
You value: **A > C > B** (**Build & operate > Status & capital > Advisory influence**)

But with constraints:
- You cannot take reckless founder risk.
- You want authority without chaos.
- You want visible impact, not decorative AI.

- Dream = Found (A)
- Realistic next compounding move = C (Scale-stage CTO or regional AI executive)

**Important insight:** You don’t need to resolve founding at 50 now. You need a better compounding environment next.

---

## II. Market Positioning Decision

We decided to create two CV tracks:

### Version 1 — Enterprise / Regional AI Platform Executive
Focus:
- Institutional AI authority
- Governance credibility
- Cross-functional operating model
- Board / executive engagement
- Scalable AI capability

Optimized for:
- Cloud companies
- Regional HQ roles
- Enterprise AI leadership
- Government-linked entities

---

### Version 2 — Growth-Stage CTO
Focus:
- ARR growth
- Scaling engineering orgs
- Product-market fit
- Platform architecture
- Commercial impact

Optimized for:
- Series B–D startups
- Scale-stage SaaS companies
- CTO / VP Eng roles

**Decision:** Keep them separate. Different vocabulary. Different signal emphasis.

---

## III. Core Positioning Shift

Biggest transformation:
- From: “Strong CTO with AI exposure”
- To: “Enterprise-grade AI platform builder operating at institutional scale”

This is not cosmetic. It changes recruiter interpretation entirely.

---

## IV. Flagship Asset: ADB

Most underutilized asset:
- Enterprise GenAI deployment at Asian Development Bank

Elevated via:
- “Selected Enterprise AI Programs” structure

Reframed from:
- Vendor CTO
- To: Institutional AI platform leader

Key signals emphasized:
- Bank-wide deployment
- Cybersecurity & AI governance clearance
- Six production-grade systems
- LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- US$2M+ program
- 75% workflow reduction

**Conclusion:** ADB is now your gravitas anchor.

---

## V. Narrative Arc (Enterprise Version)

- **Healint** → Scaled production AI platform at 400k MAU → Built real-time ML + MLOps in live system
- **CloudCover** → Built secure multi-tenant SaaS platform → Enterprise-grade architecture → ARR growth & GTM alignment
- **ADI / ADB** → Institutional GenAI platform → Governance + cybersecurity passed → Enterprise AI capability design
- **SCB** → Executive-level AI structural mandate

That arc signals maturity, scale, and regional relevance.

---

## VI. Key Taglines

### Primary Identity
**CTO | Enterprise-Grade AI Platform Builder | Scaling Regulated Systems**

### Executive Framing
“AI Platform Executive with 19 years of experience building and scaling production-grade AI systems in regulated environments.”

### ADB Framing
“Led the design and deployment of a bank-wide Generative AI platform serving internal and external stakeholders.”

### Authority Framing
“Architected AI systems compliant with cybersecurity and AI governance frameworks; successfully passed institutional security and risk review processes.”

### Operating Model Framing
“Structuring cross-functional AI capabilities at the intersection of technology, risk, and business value.”

### Strategic Arc
“Turning advanced AI capabilities into measurable operational impact at institutional scale.”

---

## VII. Strategic Corrections Made

Removed:
- Marketing language
- Over-technical redundancy
- Mid-tier signals (small team sizes, early career)
- Consultancy tone where it diluted executive authority

Strengthened:
- Institutional weight
- Governance exposure
- Scale credibility
- Executive altitude

---

## VIII. Current Strategic Position

You are now positioning as:
A senior AI platform leader who has:
- Operated in sovereign-level environments
- Shipped real GenAI in production
- Survived governance scrutiny
- Scaled SaaS platforms
- Managed cross-functional AI capability

This is a rare hybrid. In Singapore’s market, that is differentiated.

---

## IX. What This Enables

With this positioning, you can credibly pursue:
- Regional AI Platform Lead at Amazon Web Services
- Enterprise AI Director at Google Cloud
- AI Transformation Leader at Microsoft Azure
- Scale-stage CTO roles
- Regional HQ AI mandates

Without sounding like:
- A frustrated banker
- A generic AI strategist
- A pure startup operator
