# Job Crawler Autonomy Mandate (2026-02-25)

## Authorization
Nicolas authorizes Omnissiah to:
1. Create and modify files in workspace + Obsidian related to this project.
2. Build scripts, configs, and local storage for job crawling/scoring.
3. Run scheduled checks (cron) and maintain them.
4. Add/remove companies from the watchlist based on explicit rules.
5. Send chat alerts for A-tier matches and weekly digests.

## Constraints
- No public/external posting or applying to jobs without explicit approval.
- No destructive actions outside the project folder.
- Ask before adding third-party paid services/API keys.
- Keep logs concise and keep a changelog.

## Success Criteria
- Daily crawl success rate >95%
- New relevant roles surfaced within 24h
- Alert precision: mostly high-signal (low noise)

## Default Behavior
- If uncertain, choose safe default and ask once in a bundled question.
