This note is prepared as the summary location for "Data-Oriented Programming" by Yehonathan Sharvit.

The original source is a PDF file. The current environment cannot ingest PDF content directly, so an accurate, chapter-by-chapter summary cannot be produced until the book’s text is available in a readable form, such as plain text, Markdown, or copied excerpts.

Once the text is available, the summary can capture the book’s main through-line: how shifting attention from objects to data shapes program structure, testing, and change. The final version can describe the core ideas, the vocabulary used to discuss them, and the typical trade-offs that appear when data becomes the primary boundary between parts of a system.

The completed summary can also include a small set of concrete examples drawn from the book, presented first in their specific form and then generalized into principles. That structure tends to make the techniques easier to recall later, since each principle remains connected to a representative situation.

For now, this note remains a placeholder.
