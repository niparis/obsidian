# FGO — Team Comp Ideas

## Helena W1 clear -> Anastasia + Castoria core
- **W1:** Helena NP clears/softens wave 1.
- **W2/W3 DPS:** Anastasia (Arts AoE) with Castoria support.
- **Shell:** Helena + Anastasia + Castoria + flex backline (Plugsuit swap support if needed).
- **Why this works:** Helena is card-type agnostic (battery + rainbow buff), while Anastasia benefits strongly from Castoria for stable Arts damage/NP flow on later waves.

## Notes
- This is more of a practical farming shell than a strict looping script.
- Works best when charge planning is done up front (CE + batteries + swap timing).
