# FGO — Achilles NP2 Team Orders (Skadi Ruler + Waver + Koyan)

## Setup A (most reliable, Plug Suit)

**Front:** Achilles / Ruler Skadi / Waver  
**Back:** Koyan (swap in on W3)  
**CE on Achilles:** 50% start NP (or Kaleidoscope)

### Turn order

**T1**
1. Use **Waver team charge** + **Waver target charge on Achilles**.
2. Use **Achilles battery**.
3. If needed, use **Ruler Skadi target battery on Achilles** to hit 100.
4. NP wave 1.

**T2**
1. Use **Ruler Skadi Quick buff / damage buffs**.
2. NP wave 2.
3. If refund is short, top up with remaining Waver/Ruler Skadi charge.

**T3**
1. Plug Suit swap **Waver -> Koyan**.
2. Use **Koyan offensive buffs** on Achilles.
3. Use any remaining Achilles steroid.
4. NP wave 3.

## Setup B (no Plug Suit, simpler)

**Front:** Achilles / Ruler Skadi / Waver  
**CE:** Kaleidoscope or strong 50% NP CE

### Flow
- Spend fewer buffs on T1, stabilize charge.
- Use main Quick buffs on T2.
- Dump all remaining buffs on T3 for kill.

## Notes
- This is a **battery-stacked clear** setup, not a pure refund loop.
- Prioritize:
  - starting NP CE
  - good charge timing
  - saving burst buffs for W3
- **Field test update:** with low/medium skill levels, using **Kaleidoscope on Achilles** (high starting NP) solved consistency issues and enabled smooth NP chain as intended.

## Extra checks (for tighter tuning)
- Achilles Append 2 level
- Mystic Code (Plug Suit) level
- Koyan variant + skill levels
