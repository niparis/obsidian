# FGO — Skills Upgrade Priorities

## Main objective
Stabilize **Achilles NP2+ turns** without facecard dependency.

## Highest priority NP charge skills
1. **Achilles — `Diatrekhōn Astēr Lonkhē B+`**  
   - Contains self NP charge + NP Gain up.
2. **Scáthach-Skadi (Ruler) — `Fanciful Summer Nights A+`**  
   - Contains target ally NP charge.

## Practical upgrade order (current comp)
1. Achilles NP charge skill (`Diatrekhōn Astēr Lonkhē B+`) → raise first (toward 10).
2. Ruler Skadi NP charge skill (`Fanciful Summer Nights A+`) → raise next (toward 10).
3. Remaining Achilles / support damage-buff skills for kill consistency on W2/W3.

## Why this order
- Current bottleneck is **charge economy**, not just damage.
- Better charge values reduce turns where normal cards are required between NPs.

## Verification source
- Atlas Academy NA data:
  - Achilles (id 402900)
  - Scáthach-Skadi (Ruler) (id 901400)
