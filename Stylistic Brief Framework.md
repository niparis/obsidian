# Stylistic Brief Framework for AI-Driven Builds
An AI-friendly brief must steer the impression without locking creativity. This framework sits alongside any functional spec (like the Dream Escape analysis) and keeps style expressive but grounded.

## 1️⃣ Mood sentence (non-negotiable)
*“Calm, slightly mysterious, like a thoughtful puzzle you play at night.”*
This single sentence is the north star; nothing else contradicts it.

## 2️⃣ Adjective pairs with opposites
Primary tone:
- Minimal but not sterile
- Playful but not childish
- Calm but not dull
These pairs define a corridor—go too far and you’ve broken the brief.

## 3️⃣ Visual lineage (max 3 references)
Visual influences:
- Monument Valley (clarity, spatial calm)
- Early iOS 6 skeuomorphism (material warmth without realism)
- Japanese puzzle books (white space, restraint)
References inform mood, not direct copying.

## 4️⃣ Rhythm, not decoration
Interaction rhythm:
- Animations are slow-in, fast-out
- No flashing or strobing
- Feedback delays by ~100 ms before subtle confirmation
Temporal cues trump static prettiness.

## 5️⃣ Color relationships over palettes
Color philosophy:
- One dominant neutral background for focus
- One accent color used sparingly for intent confirmation
- Errors rely on motion first, color second (supports low-light comfort)

## 6️⃣ Typography as personality
Typography personality:
- Humanist, slightly rounded forms
- Numbers feel stable and readable
- Avoid ultra-thin weights
If you name fonts (e.g., Inter), explain: neutral + legible, not a branding call.

## 7️⃣ Anti-goals (trapdoors)
Avoid:
- Gamified visual noise (sparkles, bursts, confetti)
- Casino-like feedback loops
- Mobile F2P visual tropes
These keep Codex from defaulting to over-the-top patterns.

## 8️⃣ Emotional arc across the loop
Emotion map:
- Main menu: calm, inviting
- Early run: curious exploration
- Mid-run: focused intensity
- Failure: reflective, not punitive
Style can shift, but the mood sentence still governs overall tone.

## 9️⃣ Style invariant
Nothing on-screen should compete with the core action. If it draws attention, it must be justified functionally.

## 10️⃣ Mini example brief
*“The game feels calm, cerebral, and quietly satisfying. Visuals are minimal but warm, playful but restrained. Motion is subtle and purposeful. The UI should feel like a well-designed tool, not a toy. Anything loud or reward-seeking is out of scope.”*

## Why this works for AI
- Adjective pairs shrink the search space.
- Mood sentence anchors semantics.
- Anti-goals prevent pattern overfitting.
- Rhythm/emotion are easier for models than vague beauty.

> Use this note as the stylistic companion to your functional spec (e.g., [[Dream Escape Workflow]]). Keep the references alive in Obsidian so future PoC sketches can match both what the brain builds and what the taste approves.
